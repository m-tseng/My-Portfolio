# My Portfolio

Hi! Welcome to the landing page for my portfolio. Due to academic policies, we are unable to host course-related projects on public Github repos. As a result, for simplicity, Iâ€™ve chosen to have all my portfolio projects hosted in one place: via [this Google Drive folder instead](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jVBOJozpJffqsCUdugNFLoCEGPaYNNc6?usp=drive_link). Each subfolder in the link corresponds to one project, as is noted in the subfolder titles.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio! Please don't hesitate to contact me through the email address on my resume if you have any trouble accessing my projects, or have any additional questions about them.
